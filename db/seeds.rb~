# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

A group in itself does not necessarily constitute a team. Teams normally have members with complementary skills and generate synergy through a coordinated effort which allows each member to maximize his/her strengths and minimize his/her weaknesses. Team members need to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true potential, and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond their limitations.")

Conditions are terms that go to the very root of a contract. Breach of these terms repudiates the contract, allowing the other party to discharge the contract. A warranty[2] is less imperative than a condition, so the contract will survive a breach. Breach of either a condition or a warranty will give rise to damages.")
